thanks aditya

i am harsh raj and i am working as database developer in this project

so, now i'll be talking about some challenges faced during our project creation and  how we overcome them

so the primary challenge we faced 

database consistency and redundancy   -  maintaining a consistent database and working with duplicate 
data is a very problematic task, 
for dealing with this problem we introduced normalization 
concept which helps us to make database consistent and reduce redundancy.


the next challenge we faced 

data security and storage efficiency - protecting sensitive data and ensuring data storage is secure and efficient.

for that we have introduced encryption in our database, which enhances the data security and efficiency.


and the next challenge is 

high traffic management - sometimes during travel season we may face high users on our webpage 
due to which it may cause stability issues for which wehave 
introduced scalable infrastructure with auto scaling cloud services and handle high traffic.


and the last challenege we faced 

api integration complexity - intregrating different api's for different purposes is a difficult task 
due to different standards due to which
we have introduced standard data formats like json , xml. which helps in intregrating different api's.


now to the next slide
